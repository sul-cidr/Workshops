# Introduction to Machine Learning with Python

This workshop introduces the principles and practices of machine learning using the Python programming language and its associated software packages. Topics covered include the application of prominent libraries such as `scikit-learn` for document and image classification and other types of analysis, as well as the use of cloud resources for deep-learning training and prediction. The workshop assumes some basic understanding of Python and programming; completion of the Introduction to Python workshop or equivalent experience is recommended.
