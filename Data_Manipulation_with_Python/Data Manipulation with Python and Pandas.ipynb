    "### Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colaboratory\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are a way to write and run Python code in an interactive way. They're quickly becoming a standard way of putting together data, code, and written explanations or visualizations into a single document and sharing that. There are a lot of ways that you can run Jupyter notebooks, including just locally on your computer, but we've decided to use Google's Colaboratory notebook platform for this workshop.  Colaboratory is “a Google research project created to help disseminate machine learning education and research.”  If you would like to know more about Colaboratory in general, you can visit the [Welcome Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Google Colaboratory platform allows us to focus on learning and writing Python in the workshop rather than on setting up Python, which can sometimes take a bit of extra work depending on platforms, operating systems, and other installed applications. If you'd like to install a Python distribution locally, though, we have some instructions (with gifs!) on installing Python through the Anaconda distribution, which will also help you handle virtual environments: https://github.com/sul-cidr/Workshops/wiki/Installing-and-Configuring-Anaconda-and-Jupyter-Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run into problems, or would like to look into other ways of installing Python or handling virtual environments, feel free to send us an email (contact-cidr@stanford.edu).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment\n",
    "If you would prefer to use Anaconda or your own local installation of python or Jupyter Notebooks, for this workshop you will need an environment with the following packages installed and available:\n",
    "- `pandas`\n",
    "- `matplotlib`\n",
    "- `sqlalchemy`\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that we will likely not have time during the workshop to support you with problems related to a local environment, and we do recommend using the Colaboratory notebooks if you are at all unsure."

    "\n",
    "Pandas is a high-level data manipulation tool first created in 2008 by Wes McKinney.  The name is derived from the term “panel data,” an econometrics term for data sets that include observations over multiple time periods for the same individuals.<sup>[[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_(software))]</sup>\n",

    "From Jake Vanderplas’ book [**Python Data Science Handbook**](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pandas is a newer package built on top of NumPy, and provides an efficient implementation of a `DataFrame`. `DataFrame`s are essentially multidimensional arrays with attached row and column labels, and often with heterogeneous types and/or missing data. As well as offering a convenient storage interface for labeled data, Pandas implements a number of powerful data operations familiar to users of both database frameworks and spreadsheet programs."
