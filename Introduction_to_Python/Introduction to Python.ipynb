With these in hand, you'll know enough to write simple scripts and begin to explore other features of the language.\n",

    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Python is a great language for learning**\n",
    "  - Python is a relatively simple and highly readable language\n",
    "  - Python is a high-level interpreted language\n",
    "  - This makes it fairly easy to learn, and fun to code in\n",
    "  - Learning Python will make learning other languages easier\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Python is powerful and multi-purpose**\n",
    "  - Python can be used for almost anything, from writing simple scripts to automate tasks to building full-scale applications\n",
    "  - Python is “Batteries-Included” -- the Standard Library includes a huge range of modules that can be depended upon\n",
    "  - The broader Python community is huge and vibrant -- hundreds of thousands of third-party modules and tutorials cover almost all areas of computing\n",
    "    + In particular, for our purposes, Python is at the very center of the Data Science and Machine Learning ecosystems\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Python is cross-platform and free and open-source**\n",
    "  - Python is freely available and is maintained and governed by its community of users\n",
    "  - Because of this, and because of Python’s great versatility and popularity, it is available on more-or-less any computer system you are likely to come into contact with\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, an investment in learning Python is as safe a bet as you are likely to find, no matter where you are now or where you may want to go from here.\n",

    "## Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colaboratory\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are a way to write and run Python code in an interactive way. They're quickly becoming a standard way of putting together data, code, and written explanations or visualizations into a single document and sharing that. There are a lot of ways that you can run Jupyter notebooks, including just locally on your computer, but we've decided to use Google's Colaboratory notebook platform for this workshop.  Colaboratory is “a Google research project created to help disseminate machine learning education and research.”  If you would like to know more about Colaboratory in general, you can visit the [Welcome Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Google Colaboratory platform allows us to focus on learning and writing Python in the workshop rather than on setting up Python, which can sometimes take a bit of extra work depending on platforms, operating systems, and other installed applications. If you'd like to install a Python distribution locally, though, we have some instructions (with gifs!) on installing Python through the Anaconda distribution, which will also help you handle virtual environments: https://github.com/sul-cidr/Workshops/wiki/Installing-and-Configuring-Anaconda-and-Jupyter-Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run into problems, or would like to look into other ways of installing Python or handling virtual environments, feel free to send us an email (contact-cidr@stanford.edu) for an online consultation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be possible to follow along with this workshop using a regular Python console (\"terminal\", \"command-prompt\", etc.).  Please note however that we will not be able to support you with problems related to a local environment during this workshop, and we do recommend using the Colaboratory notebooks if you are at all unsure."

Both of these would probably be best handled my making the `pig_latinize()` function a bit more sophisticated.  This is a bit out-of-scope for our workshop today, but below is one approach for those who would like to go a little further.  Let us know if you'd like to know more about these kinds of more advanced techniques and packages in future workshops!\n"
